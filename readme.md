## Menu Options Explained

### 1. Create new GitHub repo from current folder
- Initializes Git, makes initial commit, and creates a new private/public repo under your GitHub account using the GitHub CLI.
- **Requires:** Authenticated `gh` CLI.

### 2. Clone existing repo
- Prompts for a GitHub repo URL and clones it into the current directory.

### 3. Merge one folder into another
- Prompts for source and target folder paths (absolute).
- Copies all files from source to target.

### 4. Set up Watch & Auto-Merge (every 24h)
- Sets a cron job to copy (merge) contents from a watched folder to a target folder every 24 hours.
- Logs output to `~/auto-merge.log`.

### 5. Update & Push Local Repo to GitHub
- Adds, commits, and pushes all local changes to the `main` branch of the remote repo.
- If no remote exists, prompts for a repo URL.

### 6. Exit
- Quits the script.

## Global Usage (System-wide Setup)

To make the script globally accessible (as `github-cli-menu`):

1. Move the script as root:
   ```sh
   sudo mv github-cli-menu.sh /usr/local/bin/github-cli-menu
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/github-cli-menu
   ```

2. Now you can call it from anywhere:
   ```sh
   github-cli-menu
   ```
